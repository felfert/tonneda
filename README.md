This is a small example for home automation with decent security, running on ESP32.

It does the following:

1. Use WiFi EAP-TLS (certificate-based enterprise authentication) to connect to a wireless network.
2. Connect securely via TLS to an MQTT broker using client-cert based authentication
3. Subscribes to topic "esp32/update" for triggering OTA updates.
4. Subscribes to topic "esp32/debug" to enable debugging
5. Subscribes to topic "esp32/nodebug" to disable debugging
6. Publishes changes on GPIO to topic "esp32/gpio" (not yet implemented)

This is WIP

Prerequisites:
- You need a local PKI infrastructure to secure all components.
  - A local WiFi network using radius-based EAP-TLS for authentication
  - A local MQTT server which uses TLS and client certificate based athentication
  - A local HTTP server for providing OTA update functionality
- Espressif's RTOS SDK, which is available at https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf
- Set it up according to https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/

Steps to build/flash/run this app:
1. Run make menuconfig, change setup according to your environment
2. From your PKI, copy the CA's certificate (PEM-encoded text) to main/ca.crt 
3. From your PKI, copy the client certificate (PEM-encoded text) to main/client.crt 
4. From your PKI, copy the client key (PEM-encoded text) to main/client.key
5. Connect your target board via USB
6. Run make flash monitor

Note:
There are **A LOT** of HOWTOs and instructions on the Internet which use the Arduino IDE and an ancient NON-OS SDK.
**DO NOT USE** these. The ancient NON-OS SDK is **OUTDATED**, **UNMAINTAINED**  and **DANGEROUS**. For example it
uses TLS v1.1 for EAP-TLS which is considered insecure and therefore is **NOT** supported by any decent Radius anymore.
This is BTW the reason, WHY those other examples do NOT work.

The new SDK mentioned above is actively maintained, uses decent libs and provides support
for TLS v1.2 and given that, WiFi EAP-TLS actually works.
